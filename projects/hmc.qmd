## Motivation

Demand forecasting underpins inventory planning, pricing, and promotion in retail.  
Accurate forecasts help Walmart maintain optimal stock levels and improve cash-flow management.  
Because weekly sales depend on many interacting factors and exhibit heavy right-skew, we adopt **Bayesian modelling** to:

* quantify parameter uncertainty;
* incorporate hierarchical (store / department) structure; and  
* obtain intuitive posterior summaries for decision-making.

## Data

We merge three publicly available Kaggle datasets[^kaggle]:

* **Store:** anonymous metadata (Type A/B/C, Size).  
* **Features:** weekly covariates 2010-02-05 → 2012-11-01 (Temperature, Fuel Price, CPI, Unemployment, five Markdown channels, *IsHoliday*).  
* **Train:** 421570 observations of weekly department-level sales.

After dropping the five *Markdown* variables (> 60 % missing), the final training set contains:

Key characteristics:

| Variable                | Type        | Note                               |
|-------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------|
| `Weekly_Sales`          | numeric     | right-skewed target                |
| `Store`, `Dept`         | categorical | 45 stores; 81 departments          |
| `IsHoliday`             | binary      | major US holidays                  |
| `Temperature`           | numeric     | °F, weekly average                 |
| `Fuel_Price`            | numeric     | regional cost per gallon           |
| `CPI`, `Unemployment`   | numeric     | economic indicators                |
| `Size`                  | numeric     | store floor area (ft²)             |
| `Type`                  | categorical | A (large) / B / C (small)          |

**Exploratory highlight**

* Sales are highest for **Type A** stores and during **holiday weeks**.  
* Larger `Size` correlates positively with sales, while higher `Unemployment`, `Fuel_Price`, and `CPI` show negative associations.  
* Sales distribution is heavily right-tailed; ∼25 % of observations are near \$0.

## Methodology

### Bayesian Linear Regression

Let  

$$
y_n \;=\;
\beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{IsHoliday}_n + \beta_2 \text{Unemployment}_n
+ \beta_3 \text{Temperature}_n + \beta_4 \text{FuelPrice}_n
+ \beta_5 \text{CPI}_n + \beta_6 \text{Size}_n + \varepsilon_n,
\qquad
\varepsilon_n \sim \mathcal N\!\bigl(0,\sigma^2\bigr).
$$

All numeric predictors are **standardised**.  
Diffuse but proper priors are used:

| Parameter | Prior |
|-----------|-------|
| $\beta_k$ | $\mathcal N\!\bigl(\hat\beta_k^{\text{OLS}},\,10^{12}\bigr)$ |
| $\sigma$  | Half-Cauchy$(0,25)$ |

Posterior sampling is performed in **PyMC 3** with NUTS (adaptive HMC).  

### Hierarchical Normal Model

To capture store- and department-level heterogeneity we extend to

$$
y_{ij} \;=\;
\beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{IsHoliday}_{ij} + \dots + \beta_6 \text{Size}_{ij}
+\alpha_i + \theta_j + \varepsilon_{ij},
$$

with $\alpha_i \sim \mathcal N(0,\sigma_\alpha^2), \;
      \theta_j \sim \mathcal N(0,\sigma_\theta^2)$  
and Half-Cauchy hyper-priors on variances.  
Four Stan NUTS chains (2 000 warm-up + 2 000 sampling iterations each) were attempted.

## Results

### Linear Model Posterior

* **Significant negative** effects: `Unemployment`, `Fuel_Price`, `CPI`.  
* **Positive** effects: `Temperature`, `Size`.  
* `IsHoliday` posterior includes 0, suggesting holiday uplift is explained by other covariates.

| Predictor        | Posterior Mean | 95 % HDI           | Direction |
|------------------|---------------:|-------------------:|-----------|
| Unemployment     | –0.121         | [–0.139, –0.103]   | ↓         |
| Fuel Price       | –0.087         | [–0.099, –0.075]   | ↓         |
| CPI              | –0.051         | [–0.063, –0.040]   | ↓         |
| Temperature      | +0.034         | [+0.023, +0.045]   | ↑         |
| Size             | +0.217         | [+0.205, +0.229]   | ↑         |
| IsHoliday        | +0.006         | [–0.008, +0.020]   | ≈ 0       |

*Economic indicators carry the expected signs; the holiday effect is largely explained away by other covariates.*


### Hierarchical Model Diagnostics
* **Between-group SDs**:  
  $\hat\sigma_\alpha \approx 0.32$ (stores),  
  $\hat\sigma_\theta \approx 0.41$ (departments).  
* **Convergence**: several parameters show $\hat R > 1.10$ and low $N_\text{eff}$; trace plots reveal funnel-like geometry → indicates need for **non-centred re-parameterisation** or stronger priors.
* **Future work**: re-parametrisation (non-centred), stronger priors, or partial-pooling with Bayesian regularisation.

## Discussion & Future Directions

* **Economic indicators** with intuitive sign explain much of the variability in weekly sales.  
* Hierarchical modeling is conceptually appropriate but numerically fragile; next steps:  
  * switch to **non-centred parameterisation**,  
  * conduct **prior-predictive checks**,  
  * explore **regularised horseshoe** priors for sparse fixed effects.  
* Incorporating explicit **time-series components** (week-of-year seasonality, AR lags) may further improve forecast accuracy.
