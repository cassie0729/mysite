# Hi, I'm **Nianlin (Cassie) Chen** ðŸ‘‹

I am a **biostatistician & statistical programmer** with handsâ€‘on experienced in clinical-trial data workflows, Bayesian modeling, and high-performance statistical computing. My current work involves mapping raw study data to **SDTM/ADaM**, automating QC pipelines and validation checks in **SASÂ &Â R**.

My longâ€‘term goal is to develop **statistical methodology for highâ€‘dimensional biomedical data**, bridging rigorous theory with practical tools that empower scientists and clinicians. I am actively preparing to pursue a **PhD in Biostatistics** to deepen my expertise in Bayesian inference, adaptive trial design, and machineâ€‘learningâ€“driven biomarker discovery.
